# Code Refactor

## Description

This repository is a refactoring of the Horiseon homepage so that the HTML uses semantic tags and elements and the CSS is less repetitive.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

I have replaced the 'div' tags with more appropriate elements that reflect the nature of the HTML for optimized accessibility and search engine results. Many sections of the stylesheet have been consildated or completed inline to make the website more compct and easier to understand at a glance. My notes and changes are still marked by comment in the code, but these can be easily removed.
